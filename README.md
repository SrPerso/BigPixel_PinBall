BIGPIXEL PINBALL:

This is our practise of Physics II, a pinball game.
We tried to copy the BigPixel Pinball from BigPixel studio, here is the original game link:
http://www.freewebarcade.com/game/big-pixel-pinball/

-HOW TO PLAY:

To throw the bal you have to mantain clicked the down arrow and then stop pulling down the arrow.
Click left arrow or right arrow to move its correspondent kicker.
You have 3 balls, when you lose all of them you lose the game.
If you want to play another time, press SPACE or wait 8 seconds when the Game Over screen appears.


-THINGS WE DIDN'T PUT:

We didn't do all of the animations, we just iluminate the bonus when the ball pass throught it.
We have eliminated all the UI where the puntuation and the balls is shown. We added this information on the title of the game window.
We only have one combo, the one that throws three balls if you make the ball go to a specific place in the map.


-DEBUG OPTIONS:

If you press F1 you will see all the chains and polygons.
Now if you click on the ball and you drag it you will be able to move it where you want.
